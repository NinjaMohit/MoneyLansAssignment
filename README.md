<h1>🚀 Exciting Flutter Project Showcase 🚀</h1>

<h1>📱 User Sign In/Out App</h1>

<h3>I'm thrilled to showcase a Flutter application that I recently built, focusing on user sign-in and sign-out functionality. 🤖</h3>
<br>
<br>

<h1>👥 Features: </h1>

<h3>User Management: The app manages a list of users, each with unique details like name, ID, and account type (Permanent/Temporary).</h3>

<h3>Sign In/Out: Users can sign in and out, with a seamless interface that dynamically updates the UI based on user status.</h3>

<h3>User Details: Explore detailed user information, including name, age, and gender.</h3>

Implemented shared preferences to persist user sign-in status.
Utilized Flutter's powerful UI capabilities for an intuitive and responsive user interface.

<h1>UI for App<h1>
  <h3>1. Use the attached JSON file as mock data as an API response, parse this user data, and display it in a list view, alongside his name there will be a sign-in button!</h3>

<br>
    <h3>1. Once the user taps on his name for the first time, he’ll be prompted a dialog where he needs to fill in his age and gender, once they have done so, it’ll take the user to the new screen where he’ll be displayed his name, age, gender!</h3>

<br>
  <br>

  
  <h3>1. Now, once this is done every individual user sign-in is retained in local storage, using the DB of your preference like Shared Preference so now the sign-in button alongside the name changes to sign-out.</h3>
   <h3>2 .The next time the user clicks over his name he is not shown the dialog, simply taken to the next screen, where his details name, age, and gender are shown.</h3>

<br>


  <h3>1. On clicking sign-out, we remove the user sign-in state from the local DB, so the button toggles to sign in again!

<h2>👨‍🚀 Why Flutter?</h2>
<p>Flutter made it a breeze to create a cross-platform app with a single codebase. The hot-reload feature significantly sped up the development process.
</p>

<h3>🌐 Future Plans:</h3>
<p>I plan to enhance this app by adding more user interactions and refining the UI. Stay tuned for updates! 🚀
</p>

<h2>🙌 Feedback Welcome:</h2>

I'm open to feedback and suggestions. Feel free to try out the app and let me know your thoughts! 🎉
